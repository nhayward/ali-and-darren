            <p>Ali and Darren's story began like all great romances: They met online.</p>

            <p>Back in January 2015, they had their first date in a bar in West Hollywood&mdash;again, as all classic romances begin. They hit it off right away and continued to date, finding the best beer and watching the newest movies, until it was obvious that they should just move in together. They picked Culver City, as it was halfway between their two apartments. Darren wouldn't miss the beach <i>too</i> too much, and Ali wouldn't be <i>too</i> too far from her favorite movie theater.</p>
            
            <p>Travel quickly became their mutual passion. They traveled everywhere together, from Tokyo to the Amalfi coast, Prague to Berlin, Vegas to Venice, and so many more places. Many people suspected that one day Darren might pop the question on one of the trips, but since they had discussed NEVER getting engaged on a trip, Ali was ADAMANT it would not happen then. Needless to say, she was shocked when, on a Thanksgiving afternoon, Darren got down on one knee as they took a detour through St. James Park in London. After all, Ali had begrudgingly agreed to this detour just to appease Darren, as they had a <i>strict</i> sightseeing schedule to keep up with! Needless to say, this was one detour worth stretching the schedule for&mdash;one that started them on their next adventure.</p>
